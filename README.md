# üåÉ Tokyoland - Hyprland Config Backup

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This is **not a Hyprland distribution**, but rather a personal **backup of my configuration files** ‚Äî at least for now.  
> That said, contributions and improvements are always welcome!

My goal is to eventually shape this into a well-rounded, **Tokyonight-themed** Hyprland setup, inspired by the [Tokyonight Neovim plugin](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) by **folke**.

## üöÄ Installation

### Welcome to Tokyoland!
So, you're crazy enough to try or mess around with my configuration ‚Äî welcome!

As of now, there is only a manual installation.

#### üìÅ Copy Config Files
Copy everything inside this repo's `.config` folders to your local `~/.config/` directory - or only the modules that interest you.
Then, edit the `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf` and make sure it points to the correct wallpaper path.

#### üì¶ Install Dependencies

You‚Äôll need a few essential packages for this config to work properly.  
I couldnt keep track of all the dependencies, but here are some that i remembered.
QT Applications are managed by kvantum, while gtk are managed by nwg-look
Also theme QT tokyonight theme seems to be a bit broken, which is why I am using the cattpuccin moccha blue theme

```bash
sudo pacman -S hyprland waybar wofi kitty rofi \
             hyprpaper hyprlock hypridle \
             wl-clipboard \
             nwg-look qt5ct qt6ct kvantum \
             gtk-engine-murrine ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-common \
```

```bash
yay -S ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd
```
